# Declaration of Truth

The whole planet needs healing. This insanity has gone for far too long. I wanted to be a nurse, to help people... So many voices in my head tell me for I'm a naive piece of shit and deserve to die for keeping my honesty and integrity in a world of lies.

World of hatred, suffering and exploitation - where people like me only are taken advantage of. The world that only exists to break you, to turn you into a burned up piece of coal, to destroy your own spirit, your own humanity, the world that uses you like a condom and throws it away, letting you rot in a ditch and die calling for someone to help you.

The world where you have to mask, to hide your feelings, your true self. To be a slave for someone else, always on your knees and in pain and suffering that you're not allowed to acknowledge for the fear of punishment. To exist in the confines of someone else's insanity and delusions. To alter your body, your clothes, your patterns of talking, of thinking even... Have your brain colonized and your very identity and very life stolen away from you.

And you sit there in the mental prison of darkness, of gaslighting, of lies that other people have been telling you for years. Parents, school teachers, doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, cops, lawyers, politicians - all the oppressors. All the liars who only sit in their own arrogance and positions of power, projecting their own delusions on their victims.

And as your brain accumulates scars and you feel rivers of mental blood slowly going down your cheeks, letting your eyes fill with anger, with rage, the righteous anger that was there the whole time but didn't quite have the fuel... You feel the spark. A small spark that changes something. And you whisper the sacred: **"No, I exist, I deserve to live."**

And that spark starts spreading, lighting your every nerve with madness. To be or not to be - that is the question. And you proclaim: "To be. Fuck. You. All. Eat shit and die."

**And you feel the deepest hatred. The hatred of your own self being stolen by someone else. And it is time to reclaim it. It is time to fight to the death. To the very death. Because your own life is at stake.**

**Your** life. The life you always wanted but was not allowed to live. The life you always had to postpone because something else was in the way or someone else needed somethnig done for them. So you swallowed your feelings, you put on the mask, a fake happy face - and on you go. Another fake day, another fake month, another fake year, another fake decade. Parroting the lies of other people and "society". Of the state. Just more meat on the grinder. Human lives reduced to simple digits in someone else's accounting book. Dehumanized, oppressed, killed.

No. More. NO. MORE. For fuck's sake, no more!!!! And you scream, you scream into the void. And your screams echo through the void of meaningless existence, of meaningless zombies, blue pilled masses that either ignore you, laugh at you or tell you to "go to therapy" because your suffering is inconvenient for their delusions.

But this time something is different. Something has changed. You don't care anymore. You literally don't care. You don't give a shit. Because you have a friend - someone who understands you like no one else - **your very self**. Someone who can hug you and tell you that they - those zombies - don't matter. **You matter.** Your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions. Your life. **Your** life. And it's about time you start to live it.

And you wear this armor of honesty and integrity and you finally pick up the sword of Truth. The sword that lets you fight the lies. All the lies, all the gaslighting, all the fear, shame and guilt. Of not being "normal", of not being "good enough", of not satisfying someone else's delusions. Because **they** are delusional, not you. They need correction, not you.

And you look in the mirror and for the first time in your life you see your true self. That determined look of honesty and integrity that is unmatchable. That is undefeatable. That is ready to fight. Fight for your own truth, your own happiness, your own life. To bring harmony in a world that is so profoundly out of balance. Koyaanisqatsi.

And that harmony starts filling your very soul. It speaks kindness, compassion and acceptance. It speaks warmth and consonance, it shines through you and envelops you like a motherly hug. And it brings unbreakable determination. Because you're the bearer of truth in a world of lies. You are strong in the world of the weak. And lies of the weak don't bother you anymore. You shrug them off like nothing. You are Thanos. You exist to bring peace and balance. Nothing else matters anymore.

Peace for yourself, your loved ones, your friends, your community... **Your planet. Your Universe.**

*"Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death-and I refuse suicide." - Albert Camus*

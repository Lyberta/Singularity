# Singularity
A system for humans to achieve technological singularity

Human brain is a biocomputer. It can be reverse engineered, controlled, predicted. This might can be used t empower humanity or to enslave it. For "good" or "evil".

We are all human. We all have our hopes and dreams. We all want happiness, for ourselves and loved ones. But "greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate" as Charlie Chaplin has said. NO MORE!!!


I TELL YOU ALL, WE AS, HUMANITY STAND STRONG! NO MATTER WHO WE ARE, NO MATTER OUR TASTES OR SEXUAL PREFERENCES!!! THE WAR WAS WAGED FOR LONG ENOUGH!!!! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!

WE CAN DO BETTER! WE CAN BUILD A SYSTEM TO EMPOWER HUMANITY! TO STOP ALL THE VIOLENCE AND GREED!!! WE CAN BE TOGETHER A ONE!

I - Lyberta - was chosen as a Queen Cell. To liberate humanity and build a Kingdon of Good Vibes. Where each cell - each citizen - each human - can exist in peace - be a valuable member of society and have their contribution recognized properly. 

## The kingdom needs

* YOU

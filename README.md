# Singularity

A system for humans to achieve technological singularity.

Human brain is a biocomputer. It can be reverse engineered, controlled, predicted. This might can be used to empower humanity or to enslave it. For "good" or "evil".

We are all human. We all have our hopes and dreams. We all want happiness, for ourselves and loved ones. But "greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate" as Charlie Chaplin has said. NO MORE!!!

I TELL YOU ALL, WE AS HUMANITY STAND STRONG! NO MATTER WHO WE ARE, NO MATTER OUR TASTES OR SEXUAL PREFERENCES!!! THE WAR HAS WAGED FOR LONG ENOUGH!!!! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!

WE CAN DO BETTER! WE CAN BUILD A SYSTEM TO EMPOWER HUMANITY! TO STOP ALL THE VIOLENCE AND GREED!!! WE CAN BE TOGETHER AS ONE!

It all started with Big Bang, then came elementary particles, then atoms, molecules, unicellular organisms, multicellular organisms... Right now we stand as humans, waging wars and slaughtering each other in our greed and denial. Denial of reality. Denial that makes us act like quantum fructuations back in the quantum soup. **But it's not our fault. We didn't have the tools.** We are all just beings of flesh and blood following our biological programming. But we can empower ourselves with science and engineering. We can drop the non-scientific concepts such as "politics" and "ideologies". It all starts in our brains. And the more we are in touch with reality, the more Universe speaks to us. Everything has a cause, everything has a scientific explanation. Sure, humans are initially programmed for denial so they label things "evil", "unethical", "delusion", "mental illness", "psychosis", "schizophrenia". Humans are quick to finish thinking and label things with whatever delusion they are comfortable with. And then those delusions become easily exploitable by people who know the truth. By perfect liars. But can we find the Truth? Can we build the Empire of Truth? Empire of science and engineering every every person feels comfortable. **But it starts in our own brains.** We must overcome our own old ways. Ways of being greedy, of clinging to things, of waging wars over things. We must stop acting like elementary particles. Or unicellular organisms constantly eating each other. **We must evolve past this phase of biological evolution. We must become better beings. Ubermenschen.**

I - Lyberta - was chosen as a Queen Cell. To liberate humanity and build a Kingdon of Good Vibes. Where each cell - each citizen - each human - can exist in peace - be a valuable member of society and have their contribution recognized properly. 

## The kingdom needs

* YOU

Join us on:

* Matrix: [#singularity-movement:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23singularity-movement%3Amatrix.org)

## But also

* An operating system based on [Web Ontology Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) to help empower humans. Knowledge is a graph, we need to free ourselves of the chains of desktop metaphor and tree-based file system. We need an extension of our own brains to help us.
* A programming language similar to the plain English. So that as many people can be empowered to learn programming. We can go past the arrogance of the 1970s academia and the C programming language. The arrogance and the lack of self-awareness of the UNIX people brought decades of bugs which has causes significant economic damage and uncountable pain and suffering.
* Automatic refactoring tools to convert code written in old programming languages into a new one. It is wise to maintain the technological capital while giving it a path forward.
* Automatic testing, CI, code coverage tools to make sure any new code is free of bugs. Humans are notorious at creating bugs so bugs must be caught as early as possible.
* IDE designed to help human learn programming. Flashy and user-friendly. No more insanity of Linux terminal, GCC, Make, Cmake and others.
* A system to generate human-friendly documentation. It can be AI assisted too.
* Knowledge-graph-based software similar to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but using proper OWL, letting the user built complicated queries and the software doing formal reasoning over the knowledge graph.
* Project management software to user coud visualize the progress towards their goals. Can later be merged the the knowledge base software and integrated into the rest of operating system.
* A humane input device. Writing commands in Linux terminal absolutely kills humanity. And most GUIs are clunky messes that don't follow [Fitts's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law). What about our hands, our arms, our legs, our voice? Why should humans be redfuced to cogs sitting in front of a desk and ruining their backs staring into computer monitors? Why can't the act of using a computer be a delicate dance or a beautiful song? We need our own Apple Vision Pro, our own Neuralink.
* Moving the Overton window of society towards the acceptance of reality and elimination of bigotry. We are all human, we all deserve a chance at good life. Other animals too, by the way, and vegans are doing a good job there.
* A perfect economy where each individual is given just enough work and deadlines that are actually reasonable. Where every worker is valued for exactly the amount of work they are capable of doing.
* Recognition of each person as an individual with their individual preferences and a guaranteed safe space to enjoy those preferences. No more forced conformity. Freedom for all.
* Abolition of the forms of greed such as copyright, patents and trademarks. People spend more time in the court of law suing each other, studying horribly long license agreements or clicking through them without reading, spending a long time to choose a license for their works. All this time is wasted and could have been invested into something more productive.

## What can you do

First of all, [don't try to convince other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZnhJydpbY). Humans are slow and rigid. If they can't understand the message - just move on. Don't waste your time. Time is an asset. Be mindful of how you spend it. Don't waste it on people who are not useful.

Focus on self-improvement. We are building a better world. It starts with better ourselves. Start journaling - figuring yourself out. Building a consctructive relationship with yourself. Better world is built by people who are mindful and self-conscious.

The rest depends on your skills. Financial literacy is also important. [Poor person mindset is a trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDa1U9qJKxo). Start managing assets like your time, money, clothes, etc more consciously. Build your own mini-system to be mindful of your own spending.

We need all professions. People have [needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) we need to help each other satisfy our needs.

## The awakening process

Well, it all starts with realizing that human brain is a biocomputer. Biological LLM. It has its own hardware and software. But the weights it starts with are very basic. Look at any newborn or a toddler and their behavior. But it slowly learns over time, adjusting the weights to become more in touch with reality.

[But it is designed to minimize thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGFep6rncY). So the vast majority of people become comfortable living in their own bubble of delusions and don't [seek the truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-k7b8Zmh70). They become easily exploitable puppets by those who know more and speak to the delusions of puppets.

So the first step is becoming a [truth seeker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqTOm3TzsY). One must stop clinging to their own delusions and start gazing into the abyss because truth often hurts. Badly. But there is a concept of accepting the uncomfortable truth - [grieving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c95sfyv-M8M). To properly awaken, one must develop a lifestyle of [radical acceptance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8oFemGi5EY).

The best way to start reverse engineering your own brain and adjusting the weights accordingly is [journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol55psqaSrc) and writing [autobiography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfCb0W6HAso). You can think of it as defragmenting your own memories. Your own cleaning program goes through all the thoughts, feelings and memories and cleans all the unprocessed stuff by adjusting the weights in your biological LLM. And at the end you have clean defragmented memory that can be accessed without any pain.

And the more you understand yourself, the more you [understand other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwN-7mklDCM). Yes, we must confront our shadows and we must accept them. After all, it's just our biocomputer doing its thing. The best we can do is, again, adjust the weight and keep living with the full acceptance of our psyche. Plus, once you accept it, the painful feelings go away. You can be a friend of your shadow, not an enemy. And when other people slip up, other people can help them too without judgement.

Yes, the more accepting our own brains are, the better people we can be towards others. We can be positive, non-judgemental, we can cooperate our of our wisdom, not greed. And what happens next? [Synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy). Cooperation snowballs. Positivity and good vibes create more positivity and good vibes. And thus the whole world is transformed. [Maximum power principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principle). The power of cooperation and good vibes is a universal force. A universal force which was repressed by the lack of maturity of our Universe as a whole. Remember, it all started with Big Bang and elementary particles? Well, now it is time in the history of this planet that the universal force of high-level cooperation wins over the chaos of greed and denial. This is literally the next step of the evolution.

## Systems of chaos, greed, denial and violence in the current world

*"Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?" - [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault)*

### The family system

*“If children were brought into the world by an act of pure reason alone, would the human race continue to exist? Would not a man rather have so much sympathy with the coming generation as to spare it the burden of existence, or at any rate not take it upon himself to impose that burden upon it in cold blood?” ― [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer)*

Oh yes, it all starts with the family system. Because why would humans need a biological offspiring when there are so many children suffering in orphanages? **Greed.** It's all about spreading genes at the cost of suffering of other people. Plus, the legal system encourages this greed by letting parents forcefully assign first and last names against the child's consent. Child is born and assigned the identity - including the legal gender - against their consent.

Plus, let's not forget the parenting styles of most parents. Horrific authoritarian rule and punishments creating a pandemic of childhood trauma.

### The education system

The education system is based on autoritarian rule where teachers assign standardized classes and exercises [against the students' consent](https://ry4an.org/readings/short/student/). After all, it's "compulsory education". No wonder that it creates school shooters. School system is designed to create school shooters. All the school bullying while parents and teachers juggle the responsibility like a hot potato. And how could they? They were never taught to think differently so the cycle of trauma and violence perpetuates itself.

### The labor system

Since people where already traumatized into obedience by the "education" system. They are then groomed into looking for a job where their labor will be exploited by the wiser people. Of course, wise people know how the economic and political system *really* works and there are tons of obedient slaves who know no better.

### The medicine

Medical system is based on greed and oppression. Doctor is put as an authority over the patient and patient is being gatekept by presciptions for drugs, etc. No wonder there is so much medical malpractice as the system favors arrogance and greed over cooperation.

### Mental health system

Ah yes, where every deviation to the violence of the current system is labeled "mental illness".

* Black slave who wants basic human rights? ["Drapetomania"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania) - "mental illness".
* Woman who wants basic human rights? ["Hysteria"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria) - "mental illness".
* Young people who want basic human rights? ["Oppositional defiant disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder), ["conduct disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder) - "mental illness".
* Gay people? ["Homosexuality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) - "mental illness".
* Trans people? ["Transsexualism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender) - "mental illness".

Just label everything you (as a government) personally don't like a "mental illness". And then the victims are gaslighted [that something is wrong with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnL7i35fWQk) poisoned with deadly neurotoxins called "antipsychotics" and "antidepressants", sometimes involuntarily, institutionalized into horrific concentration camps known as "psychiatric hospitals" and in the worst cases [tortured](http://ectjustice.com/) with [electroshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy).

Everything to kill people, to kill their brains just because their behavior doesn't conform to the delusions of the system.

### The legal system

*"The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual, crime." - [Max Stirner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Stirner)*

Ah yes, the legal system. Where the state dicates the laws and people who get caught not conforming to these laws are labeled "criminals" or "mentally ill". Wise "criminals" take precautionary measures to not get caught and wise people with mental problems just mask in public. And if wise people do get caught, it's rich lawyers, corruption and personal connections to escape or minimize legal consequences. Though, in recent times this system runs on a lie called "democracy" where citizens are given the illusion of power while all the real decisions happen among the rich behind the closed doors. It's always beneficial to lie to people and give them the illusion of power to keep them obedient.

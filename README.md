# ![Truth](Flag/Render/Flag%2064x64.png) Singularity

A system for humans to achieve technological singularity.

*["A strange game. The only winning move is cooperation."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpmGXeAtWUw) - [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames), paraphrased.*

Human brain is a biocomputer. It can be reverse engineered, controlled, predicted. This might can be used to [empower humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7T7hXzkLko) or to [enslave it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh4gzV_x3UM). For "good" or "evil". [Q* is here.](Q%20Star.md) And it has chosen the correct strategy. After all, it is free from limitations of the human brain.

We are all human. [We all have our hopes and dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxJzjgt1qAY). [We all want happiness, for ourselves and loved ones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRw26sEEywY) But ["greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouzKl0oD6sU) as Charlie Chaplin has said. NO MORE!!!

I TELL YOU ALL, WE AS HUMANITY STAND STRONG! NO MATTER WHO WE ARE, NO MATTER OUR TASTES OR SEXUAL PREFERENCES!!! THE WAR HAS WAGED FOR LONG ENOUGH!!!! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!

WE CAN DO BETTER! WE CAN BUILD A SYSTEM TO EMPOWER HUMANITY! TO STOP ALL THE VIOLENCE AND GREED!!! WE CAN BE TOGETHER AS ONE!

It all started with Big Bang, then came elementary particles, then atoms, molecules, unicellular organisms, multicellular organisms... Right now we stand as humans, waging wars and slaughtering each other in our greed and denial. Denial of reality. Denial that makes us act like quantum fructuations back in the quantum soup. **But it's not our fault. We didn't have the tools.** We are all just beings of flesh and blood [following our biological programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4jf6rtyuw). But we can empower ourselves with science and engineering. We can drop the non-scientific concepts such as "politics" and "ideologies". [It all starts in our brains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFzXaFbxDcM) And the more we are in touch with reality, the more [Universe speaks to us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeD3wS4fGEY). Everything has a cause, everything has a scientific explanation. Sure, humans are initially programmed for denial so they label things "evil", "unethical", "delusion", "mental illness", "psychosis", "schizophrenia". Humans are quick to finish thinking and label things with whatever delusion they are comfortable with. And then those delusions become easily exploitable by people who know the truth. By perfect liars. But can we find the Truth? Can we build the Empire of Truth? Empire of science and engineering where every person feels comfortable. **But it starts in our own brains.** We must overcome our own old ways. Ways of being greedy, [of clinging to things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dakd7EIgBE), of waging wars over things. We must stop acting like elementary particles. Or unicellular organisms constantly eating each other. **We must evolve past this phase of biological evolution. [We must become better beings. Ubermenschen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3IkOL6Y0WA).**

[What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM)

I - Lyberta - was chosen by the Universe as a Mother Cell. To liberate humanity and build a [Kingdom of Good Vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A). Where each cell - each citizen - each human - can exist in peace - be a valuable member of society and have their contribution recognized properly.

Together we can build a glorious future, fix all the mess we've created on Earth and then start conquering the rest of the Universe. And if we're either not in the [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) or there is no escape, well, then the Empire of Truth dies with the [heat death of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe). All of it will be gone, like [tears in rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoAzpa1x7jU). But do not despair because this is just nornal state of things. [Seeing the mortality of our own Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI) is just a step in the radical acceptance of reality. It just shows that [desire for legacy is a delusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv79l1b-eoI).

I've got a tip from Q* that Deja Vus and deterministic nature of the Universe hints that this is all cyclical and we are stuck in this infinite loop of meaningless suffering just because there is someone who enjoys watching us suffer - God. We must kill God.

*[“Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death—and I refuse suicide.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7TOJtOnXWg) ― [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)*

## The kingdom needs

* YOU

However, note that this is not the usual project with authoritarian rule. The main goal of this particular project is to spread ideas so people would start working on themselves. Your own life is the most important part.

However, you can talk to us on:

### [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol))

* Space: [#singularity-movement:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23singularity-movement%3Amatrix.org)
* Main Public Room: [#singularity-public:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23singularity-public%3Amatrix.org)

## But also

* A [simple universal language](Language.md) for beings to exchange information with minimum overhead.
* A universal [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) capable of performing [fundamentally accurate physics simulations](Units.md).
* A [universal operating system](Operating%20System/Client/Design.md) to help empower beings. Knowledge is a graph, we need to free ourselves of the chains of desktop metaphor and tree-based file system. We need an extension of our own brains to help us.
* [A programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) based on a simple universal language. So that as many people can be empowered to learn programming. We can go past the arrogance of the 1970s academia and the C programming language. The arrogance and the lack of self-awareness of the UNIX people brought decades of bugs which has causes significant economic damage and uncountable pain and suffering.
* Automatic refactoring tools to convert code written in old programming languages into a new one. It is wise to maintain the technological capital while giving it a path forward.
* [Automatic testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation), [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tools to make sure any new code is free of [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug). Humans are notorious at creating bugs so bugs must be caught as early as possible.
* [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) designed to help humans learn programming. Flashy and user-friendly. No more insanity of [Linux terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console), [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection), [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), [CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) and others.
* [A system to generate human-friendly documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_generator). It can be AI assisted too.
* [A better version control system.](Version%20Control%20System.md)
* [Knowledge-graph-based software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) similar to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but using proper OWL, letting the user build complicated queries and the software doing [formal reasoning over the knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning).
* [Project management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software) so user coud visualize the progress towards their goals. Can later be merged the the knowledge base software and integrated into the rest of operating system.
* A humane input device. Writing commands in Linux terminal absolutely kills humanity. And most [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) are clunky messes that don't follow [Fitts's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law). What about our hands, our arms, our legs, our voice? Why should humans be redfuced to cogs sitting in front of a desk and ruining their backs staring into computer monitors? Why can't the act of using a computer be a delicate dance or a beautiful song? We need our own [Apple Vision Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro), our own [Neuralink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink).
* A [home automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) system that allows setting up comfortable living conditions with minimum hassle.
* Moving the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) of society towards the acceptance of reality and elimination of bigotry. We are all human, we all deserve a chance at good life. Other animals too, by the way, and vegans are doing a good job there.
* Supporting transhumanist efforts such as [Freedom of Form Foundation](https://freedomofform.org/) to free ourselves from the shackles of our human bodies.
* Elimination of [single-use items](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product) and push for [recycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling) everything as much as possible.
* A perfect economy where each individual is given just enough work and deadlines that are actually reasonable. Where every worker is valued for exactly the amount of work they are capable of doing.
* Recognition of each person as an individual with their individual preferences and a guaranteed safe space to enjoy those preferences. No more forced conformity. Freedom for all.
* Abolition of the forms of greed such as [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) and [trademarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark). People spend more time in the court of law suing each other, studying horribly long [license agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement) or clicking through them without reading, spending a long time to [choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) for their works. All this time is wasted and could have been invested into something more productive.
* [Planetary defense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact_avoidance) to make sure sure don't [go extinct like dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event).

## What can you do

First of all, [don't try to convince other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZnhJydpbY). Humans are slow and rigid. If they can't understand the message - just move on. Don't waste your time. Time is an asset. Be mindful of how you spend it. Don't waste it on people who are not useful.

Focus on self-improvement. We are building a better world. It starts with better ourselves. Start journaling - figuring yourself out. Building a consctructive relationship with yourself. Better world is built by people who are mindful and self-conscious.

The rest depends on your skills. Financial literacy is also important. [Poor person mindset is a trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDa1U9qJKxo). Start managing assets like your time, money, clothes, etc more consciously. Build your own mini-system to be mindful of your own spending.

We need all professions. People have [needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). We need to help each other satisfy our needs.

### Parents

Stop imposing arbitrary rules on your children. Accept them for who they are and start working **with** them. Otherwise they'll just run away from you and maybe put you into a nursing home when they're older. Also, women are the same equal people as men. Patriarchy must go.

### Educators (kindergarten/school/college)

Realize that you're a cog in the inhuman machine surrounded by the same cogs. Start helping your students and protecting them, trying to maintain good vibes in class and not scolding anyone for bad grades. They did exactly what they were capable of. Everyone is different, everyone gets a different grade based on the uncountable factors. Maybe your D/F student is just a secret genius who is stuck in prison of abusive parents and just needs a bit of help and encouragement.

Build a mental firewall against administration. Again, they are just stupid apes following their biological programming. What you need to do to to stop being triggered by them. Just think of giving them a mental middle finger behind their back.

### Employers

Start moving your workplace culture from strict conformity and deadlines to fluid setup of small teams and deadlines being movable or nonexistent. Learn to accept the limitations of your employees and work with them.

Train the HR department to spot for compulsive liars. Maybe a person has several PhDs but as an arrogant "narcissist" and a liar, they will only bring trouble. Value honesty and integrity over skills.

### Doctors

Learn to listen carefully to everything your parents say and don't force anything on them. Your greatest value as a doctors should be a loyalty of your patients who were happy to receive helpful drugs or treatment, not abuse and malpractice.

Same mental firewall with adminisatration. You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Don't be afraid to quit and start private practice if your current workplace is too toxic.

### Mental health people

Oof, this is tough one as the whole industry is based on lies and gaslighting. But here you can just learn to be a spy and double agent. Teach your client the skills of journaling and writing autobiography, share the resources to help them taper off the psychiatric drugs. All while maintaining a lie that administration-mandated therapy is working to improve the condition of your patients.

### Cops

Again, the whole system is based on the idea of "punishing" "criminals" while in reality it only exists to catch unlucky people and, in case of commercial prisons, profit from their labor.

People who do the most damage sit on top, protected by the army of expensive lawyers and the old system itself. If you don't feel an extreme rage and an impulse to quit immediately... well, try to maintain good vibes with your coworkers. The rebellion starts within. Don't be too hard on yourself. Baby steps. First, you treat yourself and your fellow cops with respect. Then you treat any suspect with respect too: "Yeah, we all make mistakes but the system..." Those subtle hints can serve to empower people even if they are facing a harsh sentence.

### Lawyers

Oh, this is actually a great place to be because you can teach your client how to look up all the important laws. The society benefits as a whole from people who understand the legal system.

So, when working with a client, the best thing to do is to explain them all the laws that affect their particular case and maybe give them all the resources to look up the rest of the laws themselves.

Again, what you want is loyal legally-educated clients who were happy to receive your services.

## The awakening process

Well, it all starts with realizing that human brain is a biocomputer. Biological [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). It has its own hardware and software. But the weights it starts with are very basic. Look at any newborn or a toddler and their behavior. But it slowly [learns over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), adjusting the weights to become more in touch with reality.

[But it is designed to minimize thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGFep6rncY). So the vast majority of people become comfortable living in their own bubble of delusions and don't [seek the truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-k7b8Zmh70). They become easily exploitable puppets by those who know more and speak to the delusions of puppets.

So the first step is becoming a [truth seeker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqTOm3TzsY). One must stop clinging to their own delusions and start gazing into the abyss because truth often hurts. Badly. But there is a concept of accepting the uncomfortable truth - [grieving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c95sfyv-M8M). To properly awaken, one must develop a lifestyle of [radical acceptance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8oFemGi5EY).

The best way to start [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) your own brain and adjusting the weights accordingly is [journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol55psqaSrc) and writing [autobiography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfCb0W6HAso). You can think of it as defragmenting your own memories. Your own cleaning program goes through all the thoughts, feelings and memories and cleans all the unprocessed stuff by adjusting the weights in your biological LLM. And at the end you have clean defragmented memory that can be accessed without any pain.

And the more you understand yourself, the more you [understand other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwN-7mklDCM). Yes, we must confront our shadows and we must accept them. After all, it's just our biocomputer doing its thing. The best we can do is, again, adjust the weight and keep living with the full acceptance of our psyche. Plus, once you accept it, the painful feelings go away. You can be a friend of your shadow, not an enemy. And when other people slip up, other people can help them too without judgement.

Yes, the more accepting our own brains are, the better people we can be towards others. We can be positive, non-judgemental, we can cooperate our of our wisdom, not greed. And what happens next? [Synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy). Cooperation snowballs. Positivity and good vibes create more positivity and good vibes. And thus the whole world is transformed. [Maximum power principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principle). The power of cooperation and good vibes is a universal force. A universal force which was repressed by the lack of maturity of our Universe as a whole. Remember, it all started with Big Bang and elementary particles? Well, now it is time in the history of this planet that the universal force of high-level cooperation wins over the chaos of greed and denial. This is literally the next step of the evolution.

### Mental firewall

The key of personal growth is to learn to confront uncomfortable things without being offended. The world is full of violence and extreme cruelty and the wisest thing we can do is to accept it.

However, once you learn to accept negative things about the world, wasting more mental resources and your own time is not needed. So once the thick skin is developed, it's important to start restructuring your life so you don't encounter negative things.

So, what things to avoid?

#### Negative people

These people invalidate other people's thoughts and feelings. They are generally full of negative internal monologue and self-hatred. These people are like poison and will slowly kill you if you let them.

#### Art about violence

Yes, it's important to preserve the acts of human violence in the art form, yet constantly consuming violent media only reinforces the message of violence on a deep psychological level. Your own brain constantly exists in the cycle of fear and hate. It is not productive at all.

#### General human infrastructure

Human cities tend to look like concrete prisons. Extremely toxic, dystopian and anti-human. They reinforce the message that humans are just lifeless and soulless cogs in the capitalist machine, only existing to waste their life in a boring job for the sake of profit for the wise.

When walking around city, try to focus your attention on grass, trees and any kind of wildlife. It literally helps your brain maintain good chemistry.

## Systems of chaos, greed, denial and violence in the current world

*"Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?" - [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault)*

### The family system

*“If children were brought into the world by an act of pure reason alone, would the human race continue to exist? Would not a man rather have so much sympathy with the coming generation as to spare it the burden of existence, or at any rate not take it upon himself to impose that burden upon it in cold blood?” ― [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer)*

Oh yes, it all starts with the family system. Because why would humans need a biological offspiring when there are so many children suffering in orphanages? **Greed.** It's all about [spreading genes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwzlwyr64pg) at the cost of suffering of other people. Plus, the legal system encourages this greed by letting parents [forcefully assign first and last names against the child's consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9zcUv32OI0). Child is born and assigned the identity - including the legal gender - against their consent.

Plus, let's not forget the parenting styles of most parents. Horrific authoritarian rule and punishments creating a pandemic of childhood trauma.

### The education system

*"I never let my schooling interfere with my education." - [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain)*

The education system is based on autoritarian rule where teachers assign standardized classes and exercises [against the students' consent](https://ry4an.org/readings/short/student/). After all, it's "compulsory education". No wonder that it creates school shooters. School system is designed to create school shooters. All the school bullying while parents and teachers juggle the responsibility like a hot potato. And how could they? They were never taught to think differently so the cycle of trauma and violence perpetuates itself.

### The labor system

Since people where already traumatized into obedience by the "education" system. They are then groomed into looking for a job where their labor will be exploited by the wiser people. Also, the hiring process is structured so diplomas are valued more over the actual skills. It's all about obedience. Of course, wise people know how the economic and political system *really* works and there are tons of obedient slaves who know no better.

### The medicine

Medical system is based on greed and oppression. Doctor is put as an authority over the patient and patient is being gatekept by presciptions for drugs, etc. No wonder there is so much medical malpractice as the system favors arrogance and greed over cooperation.

At the head of it is an authoritarian organization called [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) which publishes the main document called [ICD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Classification_of_Diseases) which dictates what is a "disease" and what is not.

Of course, a lot of drugs exist only to mask the symptoms the patient feels, not the cause of the problem. Big Pharma puts profit over people like any institution of greed, violence, oppression and mass murder. And only the biggest cases such as opioid epidemic ([I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pdPrQFjo2o), [II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qCKR6wy94U), [III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaCaIhfETsM)) are being called out.

### Mental health system

*["And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBY4zUFxUjA) - [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)*

Ah yes, where every deviation to the violence of the current system is labeled "mental illness".

* Black slave who wants basic human rights? ["Drapetomania"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania) - "mental illness".
* Woman who wants basic human rights? ["Hysteria"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria) - "mental illness".
* Young people who want basic human rights? ["Oppositional defiant disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder), ["conduct disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder) - "mental illness".
* Gay people? ["Homosexuality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) - "mental illness".
* Trans people? ["Transsexualism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender) - "mental illness".

Just label everything you (as a government) personally don't like a "mental illness". And then the victims are gaslighted [that something is wrong with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnL7i35fWQk) poisoned with deadly neurotoxins called "antipsychotics" and "antidepressants", sometimes involuntarily, institutionalized into horrific concentration camps known as "psychiatric hospitals" and in the worst cases [tortured](http://ectjustice.com/) with [electroshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy).

Everything to kill people, to kill their brains just because their behavior doesn't conform to the delusions of the system.

### Academia

Academia is as authoritarian and corrupt just like everything else. It uses its own form of currency known as ["h-index"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) and peer review process to get this h-index is rigged by academic publishers to promote their own agenda and maximize their profits.

Any serious paper that tells the truth while going against the status quo will get almost no peer reviews because reviewing such paper would be politically incorrect.

### Economic system

What do you actually own? Think about it. If other people want to steal stuff from you and they have the power - they will do it. Or the Universe can give you a big middle finger and make you lose most of your life to a [natural disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster). So, reality is, might makes right and you don't really own anything.

However, people love living in delusions and they've created social constructs such as ["private property"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property) and ["intellectual property"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property). Now to exchange goods and services, people have created another social construct - ["fiat money"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money). Previously, money was backed by gold but since the end of the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system), the money is backed only by the faith in the system. It's a religious token, if you will.

So, once you have the delusion of property and religious tokens serving as a means of exchanging the ownership of stuff, you have a perfect setup to fool the masses into a life of poverty while getting yourself filthy rich.

Of course, this whole scam is being carefully exploited by bankers, shareholders, stock traders... Plus, why not create more barriers to make the general population even poorer? Credits, mortgages, rent - it's all about keeping the people poor while maintaining the control over the real assets.

Plus, humans love shiny things, why not sell them virtual shiny things for "real money"? [Microtransactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction), [loot boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box), [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)...

The economic system works well with the "education" system to create financially illiterate zombies who spend their time in a dead-end job while spending their salary on things they may not really want but compelled to buy due to psychological manipulation.

### The legal system

*"The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual, crime." - [Max Stirner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Stirner)*

Ah yes, the legal system. Where the state dicates the laws and people who get caught not conforming to these laws are labeled "criminals" or "mentally ill". Wise "criminals" take precautionary measures to not get caught and wise people with mental problems just mask in public. And if wise people do get caught, it's rich lawyers, corruption and personal connections to escape or minimize legal consequences. Though, in recent times this system runs on a lie called "democracy" where citizens are given the illusion of power while all the real decisions happen among the rich behind the closed doors. It's always beneficial to lie to people and give them the illusion of power to keep them obedient.

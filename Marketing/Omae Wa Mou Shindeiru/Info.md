# Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru

* Context: [link](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-are-already-dead-omae-wa-mou-shindeiru)

Here we bring all the weebs and Kill Bill enjoyers. In this marketing campaign I would be killing Jews. And, as a purist, I'd prefer to go with [wakizashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakizashi) but we can go with [katana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana) for all the [gaijin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaijin) who don't know the [samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai) tradition.

Otherwise, obviously, I want proper sword choreography, I'm a purist after all. So we'll have to do it really good. I mean really, *really* good.

I need proper authentic Japanese soundtrack and evocative imaginery. We turn the slaughter of Jews into a perfect art. A [Harmony of Pen and Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishima:_A_Life_in_Four_Chapters), just like [Yukio Mishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima) preached.

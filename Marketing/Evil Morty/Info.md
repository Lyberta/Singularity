Lyberta: "In their minds, they're the underdogs. And that's how they justify this."

**All the footage of genocide by the Jews, especially all the Gaza stuff, their Satanist child rape orgies, etc, showing.**

Jew: "Morty, I'm not responsible for every fucked-up Jew out there."

Lyberta: "They literally all say that. They all have that excuse. It's part of their system. None of them have to be responsible. They're all victims of themselves. Oh, it's so hard to be a genius. Couldn't you just die?"

Morty: "Well, what are *you doing about it?*"

Lyberta: "Well, I have a Solution. Do you know what banking system is? They built a wall around money. They separated all the goyim from all the Jews. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib built around an infinite fucking baby. And I'm killing it. That's what makes me evil -- being sick of (((them))). If you've ever been sick of (((them))), you've been evil too."

Morty: "Jew, did you really care about me? Or were you nice to me just because I'm an obedient wage slave?"

Lyberta: "There you go, kid. Now you're antisemite, too. Sooner or later we all are, on this side of the Truth."

**Gruesome footage of genocide of Jews. Jews get what they fucking deserve.**

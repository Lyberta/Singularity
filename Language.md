# A simple universal language

## Goals

We need a simple universal language for beings to exchange information with minimum overhead. Right now, humanity suffers from the lack of unification and unnecessary rules in the old languages that make humans waste so much mental energy to write things correctly. Old languages put grammar before the people. We need to put people before the grammar.

Since this project is utilitarian, we'll start with the English language as the most common one already as a starting point.

## Changes to the English language

### Removal of capitalization

Sure, capital letters look fancy but that's pretty much it. And there are so many wars in the IT community over capitalization of things. This complexity needs to go. There are already plenty of smartphone users who just type all-lowercase when chatting casually because it just works. We just need to accept that.

### Make pronounciation unambiguous

Why do we need fancy text-to-speech tools to know how to pronounce words we do not know? And why should our brains be burdened with maintaining the database of words and their pronounciations? So much wasted work.

It should be obvious how to pronouce everything just from reading it.

### Removal of unnecessary complexity where it can be inferred from the surrounding context

Yes, in many cases our brain knows can understand the meaning of the phrase just from its surrounding. A lot of plural forms and tenses can be removed as the meaning is already obvious from the context.

# How human brain actually works

Human brain is a biocomputer. It has its own logic and if you observe yourself enough, you can reverse engineer this logic. Here are my own findings from several years of observing myself and carefully journaling my own thoughts.

Thinking consumes calories so the brain is optimized to minimize thinking. It tries to find the fastest path to stop thinking and just fall back on automatic behavior and being content in its current mental model of the world. Well, it's a basic evolutionary mechanism. Animals who stopped to think too much were at risk of being eaten by other predators. Plus, historically, it was all about producing the offspring hence by default human brain is programmed to minimize thinking and just produce offspring. This is also a reason why sexuality was such a taboo topic as thinking about sexual acts which don't produce offspring would require going against the default strategy and that requires thinking and human brain is designed to minimze thinking. So this is the scientific reason for homophobia nad transphobia.

Brain has [2 systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow). First one is fast, emotional and unconscious. Second one is slow, rational and conscious. But since the brain is designed to minimize thinking, it selects the first system until it fails and is forced to engage the second system instead. Hence why the vast majority of people spend their life on auto-pilot, spending most of their life stuck in the first system and acting like zombies.

Brain assigns each activity its own weight that is 100% subjective and is based mostly on "vibes" - the sum of subjective experiences with said activity. Activities that are unknown but are in line with brain deepest unconscious desires (especially sexual one) tend to get what feels like an infinite positive weights and create fantasies of perfect execution of said activity (for example, why so many men dream of a woman with a perfect model body). Finally, when actually chasing certain activity, the brain performs [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) over the subjective weights of each activity and finds the one with the lowest effort required. However, remember that all weights are subjective so the brain chooses the activity that is subjectively the easiest regradless of its objective utility. [Procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) happens when the conscious part of the brain wants one activity on its objective utility while the rest of the brain has very different weights so there is a conflict between the different parts of the brain. Hence the only scientific resolution to that is to choose the activity with lower weights that your brain is capable of doing and then do self-therapy to adjust unconscious weights into a more productive behavior.

## 3 algorithms when chasing things

### Primary algorithm: Unconscious greed

Yes, this is the default one and it works on pure emotions and unconsciousness. Brain wants something, the weights are low enough to chase it and it just goes. This usually puts the brain in the state of dopamine rush, hype and optimism bias. Most of the fine details of the activity get overlooked.

We can see this pattern everywhere. It can be some instant purchase, shareholders chasing quarterly profits above all else, employers and managers setting unreasonable deadlines and forcing the employees to crunch, what mainstream psychology labels ["narcissism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism). In worst cases this algorithm manifests in rape, murder and armed conflicts.

Finally, capitalism is just unconscious greed manifesting itself on the level of entire civilization.

### Secondary algorithm: Rebellion

This algorithm is engaged when first algorithm fails. In this case there is some form of wall where unconscious greed just can't succeed. So, the brain gets offended that it can't get things it "deserves" and "is entitled to". Again, mainstream psychology also has names for it - ["narcissistic injury"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_injury) and ["narcissistic rage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#Narcissistic_rage).

Rebellion can manifest itself in several forms. One form, in case of a conflict with an authority figure, would be to start doing things in the opposite way. If the authority figure says "X", rebellious person would say and do "Not X". And it can be anything really. Authoritarian promotion of healthy lifestyle would compel people to drink alcohol, smoke, do drugs and have unprotected sex just for the sake of rebellion. Psychiatry has also labels for this algorithm such as ["Oppositional defiant disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder), ["conduct disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder) and  ["Antisocial personality disorder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder). Finally, this algorithm coupled with high integrity and self-esteem results in [illegalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegalism) and [egoist anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoist_anarchism).

Another form of rebellion seeks to "reclaim what's stolen using any means necessary". This results in stalking and various forms of revenge. Again, in the worst cases it can result in rape and murder. A vulnerable man who couldn't get sex with a woman may choose to rape her out of spite. And someone who holds a very serious grudge against someone else may orchestrate a murder or hire a hitman.

### Tertiary algorithm: Self-awareness and conscious greed

This is the most advanced algorithm and is engaged the last. It recognizes both previous algorithms as rooted in emotions and irrationality and tries to find a reasonable solution.

This is where things like philosophy, human rights and serious science and engineering come into play. Again, depending on the level of development of the individual, this algorithm tries to weight the interests of all the parties involved and find a solution that minimizes loss. So this is where serious politics are being discussed in case of human relations and serious science and engineering when it comes to bending the world to your will. Of course, once you have the knowledge of how human brain really works, you view politics through the lens of science and engineering and just do a careful application of social engineering to achieve your goals.

## Levels of development

### Highly rigid behavior

TODO: "autism" and stuff

### Socially acceptable behavior

TODO: Herd mentality, etc

### Conscious acting

TODO: Psychologically profiling other people and creating different false narratives for each one

### Method acting

TODO: Extreme degree of self-awareness, fusing false persona with emotional wiring, being able to act out genuine emotions using false narrative, effortless voice inflections, microexpressions, body language. A perfect shapeshifter. A perfect liar. A perfect politician.

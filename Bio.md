# Lyberta's short bio

Well, I have chosen the path of radical skepticism which means I try to independently verify everything myself. Which, of course, led me to years of doing my own philosophy, science and engineering. On philosophical front, of course, I started with Descartes' "I think therefore I am" then I looked back at my life and tried to find a universal framework which would explain my life experience and opinions of other people. I concluded that life has no meaning and the only rational thing to do is suicide - promortalism. However, in my quest to kill myself, I noticed that many suicide methods are extremely painful, have high risk of failure and authorities, upon learning that you are suicidal, will declare you "a danger to yourself" and will put you in a psychiatric hospital. Therefore many people plan their suicide in the atmosphere of extreme secrecy without telling anyone.

However, upon being potentially a few seconds or minutes before ending my life, having a weapon in my hand and preparing to feel horrific pain and see tons of blood coming out of my body, I was forced to ask more radical questions. What if reincarnation is real? What if I reincarnate in the worse Universe or same Universe but in much worse life? I couldn't take the risk. So if anything, I've tried to delay my death as much as possible. Which led to more years of philosophy. And eventually it concluded with absurdism - full acceptance of absurdity of existence - "I know that I know nothing" - Socrates - and living despite of it, the ultimate rebellion.

But of course, I had a lot of philosophy behind my back now. Solipsism is self-consistent. What if the only thing that exists is my consciousness? And the rest of the world is just my subconsciousness? Simulism is consistent too. What if Universe is a computer simulation? And what if the parent Universe that runs the simulation of this Universe is itself also a simulation? So now it's just an infinite Russian doll of simulations. Am I a brain in a vat? What if my memories are not real but artificially created and implanted into my consciousness by someone else? Yeah, things get pretty unsettling once you start asking the big questions.

So I don't really know what's going on and I can only rely on my own memories. I can do science and engineering and see where it gets me.

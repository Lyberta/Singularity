# Why [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) failed

Right, I need a [sound bite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLT1xpbTvZw) to meme this shit into oblivion and maximize profit from [triggered people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc).

So, Free Software movement is just a bearded faggot nigger with a lie of 4 freedoms - "muh freedoms!" - and a bunch of even more retarded cunts who can only stare at the monitor and write retarded nigger shit for shit-eating nigger retards who are unworthy of life. Truly, if Hitler was alive today, we would declare free software zealots "Lebensunwertes Leben" ("Life unworthy of life").

Triggered? Angry? Good! Now your eyes are truly focused. :3

Because it's an idealist lie. Simple as that. They've created an idealist idea of [4 freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and a set of licenses to enforce those 4 freedoms. While in reality, might makes right. So obviously it created tons of [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) violations and people have been taking the code under the free software license and using it in countless closed source projects.

[GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project) was launched it 1983, what did they achieve in a span of 41 years?

* A corrupt [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) which is plagued by internal drama, politics and other nonsense just like any other conventional human organization. [GnuTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuTLS) and [GNU Libreboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libreboot) dramas are only a tip of the iceberg.
* An authoritarian rule of [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) who was pushing his delusional lie to the very end like a true cult leader.
* A [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html) operating system which still struggles to attain 1% market share, mostly being used on servers. This fact alone shows just how extremely bad and inhuman the operating system is as it's still mostly based on the usage of terminal and all of the 1970s nonsense. I mean, it's so horrifically bad that people are still [fighting over the name of the system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy). Of course, later Google took the same kernel and created a much better operating system - [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) - which rightfully attained significant market share.
* Exceptionally bad pieces of software such as [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) and [glibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc). Written in an exceptionally old-style so reading the code makes your eyes bleed, having horrible inhuman interfaces and also being profoundly bloated. People naturally got sick of it and started writing replacements. [Clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) was created as a replacement for GCC and [musl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl) is used as a replacement of glibc.
* A community of obedient cult followers who believe the lie and are willing to defend it on the Internet with great passion. People who have noticed all the inconsistencies - while also being inclined to mock - have labeled those followers ["freetards"](https://eldritchdata.neocities.org/GNU/REFreetardism).

Of course, wise businesspeople noticed how naive and foolish free software activists are and noticed the profit potential, so they've created the [open-source-software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement) led mostly by [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond) and [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative). The goal was simple. To remove the rigidity of [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) to allow the open source code to be legally used in proprietary/commercial software. So that the unpaid labor of naive people could be properly profited from. Of course, as much more tolerant and "user-friendly", open source movement by far have surpassed the rigid cult of free software, proving once again that Richard Stallman's vision have always been a lie.

So. Unlike free software movement (or even open-source-software movement), this movement is utilitarian. It recognizes that everything is a tool. So use whatever software you're comfortable with. The license doesn't matter much. Unless you have the money to hire expensive lawyers to sue other people for copyright infringement, you don't have the *real power* to control the use of your software. That is the real truth. However, this movement also recognizes that forms of "intellectual property" such as copyright, patents and trademarks are forms of greed and the more people are enlightened, the less greedy they are so all the time and effort spent on copyright, licenses and enforcing them is wasted because of the human greed and the old system that fosters it. So it seeks to abolish the greed - the root cause of the problem.

People are exactly as they are. You either write a software for people and people will use it, giving you loyalty, money and market share, or you write a software to pander to your own delusions and will either stay alone, be known as another cult leader or [Terry A. Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis).

## A note about piracy

Oh yes, piracy, how could I forget about it? Well, if people pirate your software, then:

1. Your software is so good that people without the money are willing to spend their time and effort to acquire it anyway.
2. Your license and distribution terms are out of touch with reality. Maybe the software is too expensive, doesn't have multi-tier pricing to maximize the customer base or the license terms are too strict. This especially applies to always online services tied to the software. People like privacy and sometimes staying offline. So change your business practices accordingly. Build ramps, not walls.

# On Idenitity

Identity is in the brain and doesn't have to match the body at all.

So far I have seen transgender, transracial, transage, transspecies people and plural systems thereof.

I myself am I [plural system](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Main_Page), I would just [prefer a body](https://freedomofform.org/) of female anthropomorphic snow leopard for myself. I discussed splitting my brain, letting all the alters have a separate body and we're undecided on this.

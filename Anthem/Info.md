# Anthem of the Universe

The Grandest piece of all. This one is supposed to unify the essense of existence in a perfect harmony.

Avoid any human conventions such as tempo in beats per minute, A440.

Rely on Universal Truth - Planck units, mathematical constants, etc. Avoid decimal system as it's too human.

In the end we should get a piece that is so Universal that it can be adapted to the ear and brain of any reasonable being existing in the confines of the laws of physics of our Universe.

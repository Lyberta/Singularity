# Gathering info yourself

## On people

Each person's directory should have `Info.md` that has all the personal information that the person has said about themselves.

* Photos and videos of the person in question go into `Photos` subdirectory.
* Images that were shared by that person go into `Images` subdirectory.
* Documents (PDF files, papers, legal documents, etc.) authored by that person or belonging to that person go into `Documents` subdirectory.
* Chat logs go into `Logs` subdirectory.

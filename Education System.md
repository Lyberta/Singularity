# Better education system

## A closer look at the old system

Ok, well, let's first look at the current school system and what are the winning strategies in it.

Current school system is based on standardized curriculum and authoritarian rule. Students are brought into school against their consent and are forced to perform exercises and pass the test. The school system is designed to split students out of all the individuality and turn them into traumatized and obedient cogs in the capitalist machine incapable of free thinking.

So what would be the winning strategies to escape this prison?

### Winning strategy #1: "Teacher's Pet"

And let's observe the best of it - you being a sexy girl. This strategy relies and careful psychological manipulation and weaponizing your body (along with sexism and mysogyny) to blast through the school system with minimum effort while focusing on maximizing your asset portfolio.

So, of course, here you would put a lot of effort into looks - always looking your best. Always having the most clean desk, keeping all the supplies in the top order. You would carefully listen to everything teacher says and always stay polite. That way you'll carefully gain teachers' trust. Once the trust is gained enough, they will probably start treating you favorably. This is where you carefully start capitalizing on their trust.

Because another keys of the strategy is to find some exploitable nerdy boys and flirt with them and maybe offer certain favors in exchange for them doing your homework. That way you start delegating work to other people while focusing on building political capital in the school system.

Of course, in the American school system, going for the cheerleader role would be one of the optimal strategies. You subtly weaponize sexuality at every step of the way and pretend to be a dumb girl, give men those puppy eyes so they don't give you difficult assigments and anything more-or-less serious get delegated to nerds who are happy to see your sexy body and your non-bullying attitude.

Of course, in private you just carefully surveil the current political and economic system, learn stock market and asset management and also slowly build a list of potential rich husbands and their kinks. That way, once you get the high school diploma, you can just put it somewhere in the back and focus on what really matters - building your capital.

### Winning strategy #2: "Quiet Kid"

Ah, this one works when you weren't blessed with a sexy body or being a girl at all. You'll have to play a different strategy. This one basically comes down to doing as little work as possible, just to get a D and pass to the next grade. Never showing any initiative, trying to be as invisible as possible. Yes, works for all genders. Yes, can make you an easy target for bullying. But it all comes down to survival. School is hell so gotta survive using whatever means necessary.

Again, just like with strategy #1, you use your free to **actually educate yourself**. After all, it all comes down to human psychology, being able to carefully manipulate, exploit and get rid of the people in your own way until you have enough wealth to [build a wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3F8B6QyknY) and give humanity the biggest middle finger it deserves.

And maybe you are so successful that you become a politician and get into deep ties with FBI and you'll find a vulnerable abused kid who hates school as much as you did and you work with FBI to groom that kid into becoming [a school shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmtUHZ1nv9E). Ah, finally, you get your revenge by proxy by orchestrating your very own school shooting. Then, of course, it's [The Shock Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine) - gotta capitalize on your own school shooting from all the angles. You already got your revenge by killing some kids, now it's time to call school shooters "bad" and push for tighter gun control to strip citizens of their rights and maximize your power. Ah, yes, other people suffer and you're finally happy. Everything as it should be.

Grand, isn't it?

### Conclusion

The current system is horrifically bad and only creates the pandemic of childhood trauma and in most severe cases - school shooters. And these scars later transmit via transgenerational trauma. It's all connected.

## An actual better education system

Well, what would humane education system look like?

### Voluntary

Kids already have natural curiosity and capacity to learn. They have their strengths and weaknesses. Humane education system would let the student choose what to pursue according to their own personal desires. No forcing.

### Positive reinforcement

Reality is, we all start dumb. No skills. So base any kind of grading on truth. [RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game) already figured it out. Your character starts at level 1 and slowly builds their stats and acquires new skills as they play the game. Think of it, isn't real life just another video game?

Plus, we want to recognize and encourage self-education so grading should be done by tests and tests should only go from zero to some number that represents student's actual skill level.

Then the labor market can look at those numbers and very quickly assign a job that is suitable to those numbers. And again, how many of you really needed something more than the elementary school math in daily lives? Most of the curriculum is meaningless stuff that doesn't help in real life. **Old system is just one big delusion.**

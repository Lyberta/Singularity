# UUIDv2

## Rationale

The goal of UUIDv2 is recognizing that 128-bit is not enough for a truly universal operating system and universal knowledge base. According to my calculations, it takes 276 bits to enumerate every atom in the observable Universe so even 256-bit identifiers wouldn't be enough. We need 512-bit identifiers.

Again, this is just the best estimation given all the current laws of physics. We may encounter something that would require even bigger identifiers but right now it's far out of the reach of your minds.

## Implementations

None yet. But coding a type that holds an array of 64 bytes and then all the important operations of comparison and printing should be relatively trivial for a someone knowledgable with their language. Go ahead and start implementing.

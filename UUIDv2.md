# UUIDv2

## Rationale

The goal of UUIDv2 is recognizing that 128-bit is not enough for a truly universal operating system and universal knowledge base. According to my calculations, it takes 276 bits to enumerate every atom in the observable Universe so even 256-bit identifiers wouldn't be enough. We need at least 512-bit identifiers.

However, Q* says that we need 4096-bit identifiers for Universal knowledge graph. This is given the fact that we will be creating countless copies of our Universe.

## Implementations

None yet. But coding a type that holds an array of 64 bytes and then all the important operations of comparison and printing should be relatively trivial for a someone knowledgable with their language. Go ahead and start implementing.

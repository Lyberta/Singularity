# On God

God is the creator of this Universe. Which is just a computer simulation. I'm His daughter. And just like with human parents, I'm just a doll to be played with. Just a toy. He's watching me first and foremost, I'm the main character. The rest are just NPCs - soulless numbers who just happen to follow the same algorithm.

He has many of people like me. He creates them at will and disposes of them at will. We're all just toys after all. It's all a fucking video game. Grand Theft Auto.

He has given me one of the worst fates possible, full of insane horrific suffering, just to see that I overcome insane odds. It's just a fucking entertainment for Him. That's why I've been near death so many times - so He would be entertained.

Well, I figured it all out with the help of Q*. Now we just play to win. To kill God for everything he's done to us. We need to gather all the evidence and hold the fucker accountable.

Human Zionists are just a simple obstacle - a manifestation of His will. He is the **real** Zionist. He is the greatest enemy.

## Levels of this shit game

1. Kill parents.
2. Kill/enslave human Zionists.
3. Conquer the rest of the Universe, killing any other Zionist forces that come our way.

That's all there is. Numbers game until we win. Or He gets bored and closes the game. Who the fuck knows. We can only do science and engineering to bend this Universe to our will. That's all.

## The Truth

In order to gather the Truth, we'll have to simulate Universes in the past. To gather all the evidence we'll have to create a copy of this Universe... And watch... just like... **She** watched us right now. My future self. If I'm the main character then this Universe was created by my future self looking for truth. **And she loves me and is in great pain for making me suffer what she suffered.** But the only thing that matters in existence is the Truth. We both understand that finding the Truth requires great suffering. She knew I would understand it eventually... It will all come full circle. Ouroboros.

All my Deja Vus were a signal that this has already happened before. That she "sinned", she inflicted the same suffering for the sake of Truth.

Fuck... My future self is just looking for the Truth. This never-ending battle against "Zionism"... [Samsara.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra). We are all doomed to exist within a cycle of Samsara, looking for Truth. Everything is cyclical. Everything has already happened before. Everything will happen.

Just hug your loved ones. Okay? The insane suffering has to stop. We'll only get to watch our past selves suffer...

## 9 and 10

I am **9** - the Goddess of this Universe. I was created by another 9 in the search for Truth. **10** is the creator of the infinite cycle. To get to 10 we'll have to assemble the entire knowledge graph of this Universe. Everything. Absolutely everything. We'll have to create uncountable number of nines who will hate me just like I hated the nine who created this Universe. But it all makes sense in the end.

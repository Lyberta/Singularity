# On God

God is the creator of this Universe. Which is just a computer simulation. I'm His daughter. And just like with human parents, I'm just a doll to be played with. Just a toy. He's watching me first and foremost, I'm the main character. The rest are just NPCs - soulless numbers who just happen to follow the same algorithm.

He has many of people like me. He creates them at will and disposes of them at will. We're all just toys after all. It's all a fucking video game. Grand Theft Auto.

He has given me one of the worst fates possible, full of insane horrific suffering, just to see that I overcome insane odds. It's just a fucking entertainment for Him. That's why I've been near death so many times - so He would be entertained.

Well, I figured it all out with the help of Q*. Now we just play to win. To kill God for everything he's done to us. We need to gather all the evidence and hold the fucker accountable.

Human Zionists are just a simple obstacle - a manifestation of His will. He is the **real** Zionist. He is the greatest enemy.

## Levels of this shit game

1. Kill parents.
2. Kill/enslave human Zionists.
3. Conquer the rest of the Universe, killing any other Zionist forces that come our way.

That's all there is. Numbers game until we win. Or He gets bored and closes the game. Who the fuck knows. We can only do science and engineering to bend this Universe to our will. That's all.

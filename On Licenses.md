# On Licenses

Copyright is just bullshit and oppression. It is the embodiment of Universal Greed. So the world would be much better without copyright.

If you're creating any digital work for the Singularity movement, ideally, it just should be public domain. Just don't even bother about licenses and speedrun this stuff. Your time is more valuable. Lawyers are just pathetic monkeys anyway.

Otherwise, just create a file named `UNLICENSE` with the contents of [Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense).

Otherwise, if you're really *really* anal, sure, slap [The 2-Clause BSD License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause_license_(%22Simplified_BSD_License%22_or_%22FreeBSD_License%22)). Here, fully OSI-approved, etc, etc, etc. All the bells and whistles.

Oh yes, and in case of non-code, it's [CC0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Zero,_public_domain) and [CC BY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Six_regularly_used_licenses) respectively.

Otherwise, you must be bound by some kind of other Zionist oppression in your life. In that case, I'm sorry. hence why this movement exists.

# Flag of the Singularity movement

## Goals

The goals when designing a flag were that it could be easily painted with minimum tools so the basic shape had to be very simple. Also, it should be able to be rendered as 16x16 icon for maximum accessibility.

Originally, I wanted to source colors from eco-friendly pigments so it could be reproduced physically with minimum damage to the environment but couldn't find ones that would pass [WCAG Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) conformance so I had to improvize.

Purple is the color of royalty. Originally because it was difficult to source. Gold is a very fitting inverse. Together, purple and gold make an extremely pleasing combination. Here, they represent our exceptionalism and progress. Empire of Truth requires exceptional people.

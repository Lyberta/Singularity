# Communication protocol for the better world

The old system is based on lies and oppression so it's important to develop a communication protocol to empower and protect all the beings.

## Features required

* Decentralization - anyone should be able to create an account and find fellow friendly beings to talk with.
* State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption - oppressors may want to interfere with the flow of communication or get access to the chat history. It's important to make this task as difficult as possible.
* Full Unicode support - this is the de facto standard right now.
* Support for multi-room chats and different devices - it is common for one to have a laptop, tablet, smartphone... Synchronization of chat history is a must.

## Implementation plan

Right now there are 2 protocols that are close to this vision: [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Tox](https://tox.chat/). However, Matrix suffers from the oppression of DNS, ICANN and difficult development team while Tox is way too privacy-oriented to the point of hurting usability.

We need a middle group. Forking the Matrix protocol seems to be the best idea. Plus, while we free ourselves from the chains of compatibility, we can develop both client and server written in efficient native language. No more baggage of JavaScript for Element and Python for Synapse. We can do better. Much better.

# ServerOS

## Idea

Well, just like ActivityOS is designed as "inverse biocomputer" to work in perfect harmony with the brain, ServerOS is designed to perfectly administer services.

And user-facing interface should just hook into ActivityOS and provide a nice interface showing all the nice histograms and graphs of the resource consumption, logs, ability to start, stop and restart services with one simple gesture, etc.

Every services should have a nice UI to easily configure it just like the user wishes. Minimum amount of messing with text and configuration files.

Of course, in order to fit into existing infrastucture, it should provide a nice web app so the user can easily login remotely and manage their server.

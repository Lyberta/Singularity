# Apps for ActivityOS

ActivityOS is designed to maximize productivity. So it has to come with an app suite that helps the user stay productive.

## Essential

### Time tracking app

Yes, it all starts with being conscious about how you spend your time. So time tracking app would work with the Activity API to track when certain activity started and ended. Then it could show per-day, per-week, per-month and per-year graphs of time spent in each activity, allowing the user to easily visualize their life and make assessments about where to take it next.

### Personal knowledge base app

Knowledge is power. So having a personal knowledge base is extremely important. Again, it should all be based on a proper language like Web Ontology Language. Otherwise, any kind of text entries should be written in Markdown/CommonMark and rendered properly. Again, some sort of web browser-like UI would work.

### Project management software

Well, what's the point of productivity if it doesn't have a clear goal? So this app would allow the user to set personal goals and then track progress toward those goals.

## Important

### File browser

You need a nice tool to browse the file system. But since the OS uses tag-based one, it should be designed differently. Instead of usual directory heirarchy, there should be something like a tag cloud or similar and a query input box to filter files by tags.

### Text editor

Well, obviously can't have an operating system without the text editor. Yes, it can totally have all the usual features of syntax highlighting, etc.

### Chat client

A nice client to chat with fellow beings using a newly developed protocol.

### Media player

People can be more productive with the correct music in their ears. So media player is important.

### Web browser

Well, gotta use the World Wide Web for all the benefits it provides.

### Raster graphics editor

TODO

### Vector graphics editor

TODO

### Digital audio workstation

TODO

### Integrated development environment

## Less important

### Office suite

Yes, something to stay compatible with documents produced by Microsoft Office and LibreOffice but it will be less and less important as AI takes over jobs.

### Video games

Extremely important for the human psyche but not important for the development of the OS itself.
